This is a test post to make sure everything is working correctly. 
I will also use this space to detail my process of setting up GItHub Pages using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

By the way, WSL is awesome and I really look forward to using my Linux GUI apps on Windows when it's finally released.
Unfortunately, this feature is currently exclusive to users of Windows 11. What a bummer.

I created this post file in Visual Studio Code using my WSL remote. I don't really like doing git, programming, or really much of anything using native Windows. 
I would honestly rather use Linux full-time but I cannot do that right now, sadly.

But VS Code's WSL Remote is great. I can edit and possibly even create files with the GUI without having to use things like GNU Nano or vim. Those tools are just fine, but I would rather use a GUI like some kind of monkey. 

Learning how to use git has been quite the adventure. I had some experience with this in the past, but it really is a game changer, knowing how to do even the most simplest of operations like pushing and committing your own changes to your own repository. 
I can see why it's such a popular tool among developers. I don't really consider myself to be a programmer but I can definitely see the appeal.

On another note, it's unfortunate that VS Code doesn't have a spelling checker by default. Maybe there's an extensino for that somewhere?

On a final note, Jekyll is really cool! I know I can use something simpler like Wix or WordPress but honestly, why would I do that? GitHub Pages is free, and I got to learn a thing or two about git and markdown in the process. 

If this post works properly, I may continue work on this site in the future. Bye for now.
