It's been quite a while since my last post. I don't think I even have my original SSH keys anymore, so I may have to push this via HTTPS. Oh well.

I have two new repositories up, both of which are forks of existing projects. I've decided to try and learn Godot's new GDScript 2.0, which is set to be released in Godot 4. The software is in the alpha stage at the moment, but I think it's stable enough for small projects.

I may learn C# later on, but I feel that my time would be best put towards getting familiar with the new software. I must stress that I am a beginner, and I have no idea what I'm doing half the time. I'm spending a lot of time reading documentation and watching tutorials on YouTube.

I’ve successfully ported two existing projects to Godot 4, both originally written by Miziziziz. I feel like I’m starting to get the hang of things, but I still don’t have a firm grasp on things like signals and such. I do feel a bit less lost when I’m reading the API reference though so I suppose that’s progress. 

I should probably document the whole process for porting both projects, but that seems like a lot of work. Maybe I should complete more projects so I will know what I’m talking about first. 

I’m already out of things to say here. I may post again at some other time.
