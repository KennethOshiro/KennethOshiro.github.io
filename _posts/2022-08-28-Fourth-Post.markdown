I've recently started using Ubuntu GNU/Linux again, since I got tired of having to use Windows 10 for everything.
 
It's admittedly a touch slower than Windows, since I'm running off a regular external spinning hard disk drive as opposed to a nice modern SSD.
 
I’ve admittedly been quite the Linux/libre open source fanboy for quite some time now. I honestly don’t think anything will ever convince me that proprietary software is in any way more desirable, better, or more ethical than free and open source software. Rather, I don’t want to be convinced nor do I want to even entertain that notion. If a stranger baked a cake for you, wouldn't you want to know what he put in it? Exactly. Even if I hadn’t the slightest clue about baking or cooking, I would very much like to know if someone put cow dung into my stew. 
 
Maybe this is a flawed argument. But by their works, you shall know them. That’s all I’ll say about this for now. 
 
Anyway, I’m quite liking Ubuntu so far despite its sluggish performance on a regular HDD. I did run into one annoying problem where my whole system would freeze up when trying to run the Firefox web browser. I’ve always had some problem or another with Firefox on Linux, but this is by far the most egregious. I’m quite sure Firefox is the culprit here, because I had the exact same issue three times, all when running the browser. Then I remembered that this latest release of Ubuntu packaged Firefox as a snap package. 
 
For those of you who are not familiar with the Linux ecosystem’s myriad of package formats, I will attempt an explanation. No I won’t, actually. Basically, snap packages are a relatively new technology that has no business being bundled into a Long-Term Support release. What was Canonical even thinking? Wouldn’t it have been more prudent to save such exciting and untested features for an interim release? But I guess the Ubuntu team knows something I don’t. Whatever their reasoning, I cannot use Firefox until this issue gets ironed out upstream. Yes, that’s right. Not only am I forced to use Firefox as a snap (which I won’t), I can’t even go back and use the tried and tested .deb version of the package. 
 
Speaking of snaps, Ubuntu’s Software app also has some rather annoying performance issues. It’s basically a graphical front-end for installing mainly snap packages. I’ve heard people complaining about Ubuntu’s snapcraft store. The main gist of arguments against it has been that the store itself is not open source software. This isn’t the first time the Ubuntu team has bought the ire of the OSS community and it may certainly not be the last. So why do I keep using Ubuntu? Why don’t I just go use something like Fedora or Arch? 
 
I’m just more used to Ubuntu, honestly. I still like it quite a bit and I can just use the Google Chrome browser until things are fixed with Firefox. Chrome also has its own small nagging issues (such as being mostly closed source) but at least it won’t completely lock up my system and force a hard restart. If I sound like a hypocrite for using Chrome, well that’s because I am. Sorry. 
 
I’ve managed to port two more Godot 3 projects (both originally by Miziziziz, as always). I think I’m starting to get a slightly better handle on things. I suspect we might see another Godot 4 alpha snapshot sometime soon. I’ll have to test out all my previous ports when that does happen. Honestly, none of my ports are even all that good. They just barely work but there are still some graphical errors or some jankiness that just doesn’t look quite right. I’m mostly just doing these ports to get used to the new GDScript. I don’t plan on publishing any binary builds unless I’ve expanded or extended the original project in some non-trivial way. Well that’s all for now. I might post again next week, or maybe not. But I’ll try to do another port, at least.
